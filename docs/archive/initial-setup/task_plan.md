# Task Plan: Split Product Agent Team Into Starter Files

## Goal
Create a reusable starter file structure from the architecture spec so it can be plug-and-play across projects.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Extract required starter artifacts
- [x] Phase 3: Create starter directories and files
- [x] Phase 4: Validate structure and deliver

## Key Questions
1. Which files are essential for immediate harness setup?
2. Which templates should be concrete versus placeholders?
3. How can this structure support private reusable skills next?

## Decisions Made
- Build a practical v1 starter pack with templates that map directly to your new harness extension.

## Errors Encountered
- None.

## Status
**Completed** - Starter harness scaffold created and validated, including private skills starter structure.
