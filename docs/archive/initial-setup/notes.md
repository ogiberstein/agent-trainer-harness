# Notes: Starter Files Scaffolding

## Sources

### Source 1: Product Agent Team architecture document
- Path: `/Users/ogiberstein/Documents/Coding/agent_trainer/# Product Agent Team — Architecture & Sp.md`
- Key points:
  - Includes new comprehensive harness extension section.
  - Defines starter directories for harness, profiles, memory, evaluation, and operations.
  - Includes setup engineer role and canonical schemas/contracts.

## Synthesized Findings

### Must-Have Starter Files
- Harness adapter contract
- Routing policy
- Permissions matrix
- Profile templates (org/project/merged placeholder)
- Memory policy and index
- Evaluation templates
- Operations runbook/changelog/sla
- Generated-agent output directory placeholder
- Role prompt files for orchestrator + specialists + setup engineer
- Handoff, QA, and docs templates for end-to-end execution

### Next-Step Alignment
- Keep structure private and local so pre-built internal skills can target stable file paths.
- Add a private `skills/` library with template, registry, and security policy to avoid relying on untrusted online skills.
