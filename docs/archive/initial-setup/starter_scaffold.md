# Deliverable: Starter Harness Scaffold

## Goal Achieved
A plug-and-play starter file structure has been created from the architecture specification, including private skill scaffolding.

## Created Areas
- Core project templates: `BRIEF.md`, `STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`
- Specs templates: `specs/requirements.md`, `specs/ui-spec.md`, `specs/architecture.md`
- Harness core: `harness/adapter-contract.md`, `harness/routing-policy.md`, `harness/permissions-matrix.md`, `harness/adapter-config.yaml`
- Base role prompts: `harness/agents/*.md` including `setup-engineer.md`
- Generated prompt destination: `harness/generated-agents/README.md`
- Profiles: `profiles/org-profile.yaml`, `profiles/project-profile.yaml`, `profiles/merged-profile.yaml`
- Memory governance: `memory/index.json`, `memory/policies.md`, snapshot/summary placeholders
- QA and handoffs templates
- Documentation templates in `docs/`
- Evaluation and operations templates
- Private skills starter: `skills/README.md`, `skills/_TEMPLATE/SKILL.md`, `skills/registry.md`, `skills/security-policy.md`

## Next Step
Create your first internal skill from `skills/_TEMPLATE/SKILL.md` and register it in `skills/registry.md`.
