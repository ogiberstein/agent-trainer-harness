# Requirements: [Project Name]

## Problem Statement
What problem are we solving and for whom?

## Users
- Primary: [who]
- Secondary: [who, if any]

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Feature | Priority | Acceptance Criteria | Out of Scope |
|----|---------|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| FR-001 | [name] | Must / Should / Could | 1. [criterion] 2. [criterion] | [exclusions] |
| FR-002 | [name] | Must / Should / Could | 1. [criterion] 2. [criterion] | [exclusions] |

Every FR needs at least 2 acceptance criteria. This is the gate for Phase 1.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [target, e.g., "page load < 2.5s"]
- Security: [level, e.g., "standard web app security"]
- Accessibility: [level, e.g., "WCAG 2.1 AA" or "not required"]

## Constraints
- Tech stack: [mandated or flexible]
- Timeline: [deadline]
- Third-party dependencies: [list or "none"]

## Risks, Assumptions, and Concerns
Before locking requirements, list what could go wrong, what you're assuming without evidence, and what you'd challenge if you were reviewing this as a skeptical senior colleague.

| Type | Description | Mitigation / Decision Needed |
|------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Assumption | [e.g., "user has reliable internet"] | [validate or accept risk] |
| Risk | [e.g., "third-party API may rate-limit us"] | [fallback plan or escalate] |
| Concern | [e.g., "scope feels too large for timeline"] | [cut scope or extend timeline] |

If this section is empty, you haven't thought hard enough.
