Use these scenarios to validate agent/profile changes before promotion.

1. CRUD web app with authentication and role checks
2. Data-heavy dashboard with accessibility constraints
3. API-first service with strict error semantics
4. Legacy enhancement with existing code constraints
5. Mid-flight requirement mutation and recovery

## For each scenario, record
- Input brief
- Expected artifacts and gates
- Pass/fail outcome
- Cost and latency
- Regression notes
