# Project Brief

## Project Name
<!-- A short, memorable name. Avoid generic names like "App" or "Platform". -->

## Goal
<!-- What outcome should be delivered? Focus on the user's problem, not features.
     Good: "Enable freelancers to invoice clients and get paid within 48 hours."
     Bad: "Build an invoicing app." -->

## Users
<!-- Who is this for? Be specific. Include primary persona and any secondary users.
     Example: "Solo freelancers (1-person business) doing <$100K/year revenue." -->

## Scope
- In scope:
  <!-- List concrete deliverables. Be ruthless — everything not listed here is out of scope. -->
  - [...]
- Out of scope:
  <!-- Explicitly state what will NOT be built. This prevents scope creep downstream. -->
  - [...]

## Constraints
- Tech stack: <!-- Mandated technologies, or "team's choice" if flexible -->
- Timeline: <!-- Hard deadline or target, e.g., "MVP in 2 weeks" -->
- Budget: <!-- Token/cost constraints, hosting limits, or "unconstrained" -->
- Compliance/security: <!-- GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, or "standard web app security" -->

## Success Criteria
<!-- How do you know this project succeeded? Use measurable outcomes where possible. -->
- [ ] <!-- e.g., "User can complete core flow end-to-end" -->
- [ ] <!-- e.g., "Page load under 2.5s on mobile" -->

## Prior Art and Context
<!-- Link or describe any existing systems, prototypes, competitor references,
     or user research that should inform this project. Delete section if none. -->

## Notes
<!-- Any additional context, preferences, or constraints from the requester. -->
