# Project Documentation

This directory contains documentation produced during the project lifecycle.

## Files

- `API.md` — API endpoint documentation (if applicable)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution guidelines
- `SETUP.md` — Setup and installation instructions
- `walkthrough.md` — Example harness walkthrough (Todo API)

## When to Produce These

Documentation is produced during **Phase 5 — Documentation** of the full mode delivery sequence. The Documentation Writer role reads specs, code, and QA outputs to produce accurate, complete docs.

## Guidelines

- No placeholder text in shipped docs.
- Setup steps must be explicit and verifiable.
- Known issues and workarounds from QA should be reflected.
- API docs should include method, path, request/response examples.
