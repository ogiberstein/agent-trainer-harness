# Growth Social Distribution Strategy

## Purpose
Design a repeatable social distribution system that maps product value to channel-native content.

## Use When
- Launching features and needing awareness/traffic.
- Building a recurring top-of-funnel content plan.

## Inputs Required
- `BRIEF.md`
- `specs/requirements.md`
- `specs/growth-plan.md` (if present)
- Target channels and audience profile

## Steps
1. Pick channels by audience-channel fit and production capacity.
2. Define 3-5 reusable content pillars tied to product value.
3. Define cadence and repurposing workflow across channels.
4. Map each pillar to CTA and destination page.
5. Define KPI tree (reach -> engagement -> click -> conversion).

## Output Contract
- Distribution section in `specs/growth-plan.md`
- Channel calendar and experiment ideas for next 4 weeks

## Safety and Security
- Avoid spam tactics and policy-violating growth shortcuts.
- Ensure posts do not reveal sensitive implementation details.
